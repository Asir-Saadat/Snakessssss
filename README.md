About the Game
This is a two player game where one is labeled as the culprit and the other one is labeled as the police.
The culprit tries to gain as much point as possible during the game. He also has two super powers
1. He gains double points for each fruit
2. He gains invulnarability for a brief amount of time. 
This power can be gained possible only when culprit eats the special fruit.

After this round, it's the vice versa, after two rounds, the player with the most points wins.
